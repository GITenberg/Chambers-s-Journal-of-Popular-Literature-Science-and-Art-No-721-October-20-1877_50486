<h2><a name="TOYS" id="TOYS">TOYS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> British industries, not the least interesting
to a large world of readers, great and small, will
be found the manufacture of toys. Mr Bartley,
in treating this subject in Mr Stanford's useful
series of Handbooks to British Manufactures,
rightly assumes that objects which are so inseparably
connected with the happiness of our early life
cannot be held unimportant; while we need but
mention the name of Charles Dickens, in order to
lend a charm to the avocations of a doll's dressmaker
and a journeyman toy-maker. Although
the English productions are almost entirely confined
to a few special types of goods, which not only
hold their own among foreign rivals, but are largely
exported to the continent, we find that in London
alone there are, besides various importers of toys,
eleven rocking-horse manufacturers, ten wholesale
dealers, and one hundred and fifty-one retail
dealers, not including the large tribe of small
retailers, who combine other occupations with the
sale of toys. Though Germany, Switzerland, and
France are the great storehouses of all toys of
which the material is soft wood, the toy manufacture
of London forms a large and interesting
industry.</p>

<p>Penny wooden toys are turned out of a manufacturing
establishment which consists of a toy-maker,
his wife, and family. When the father has
finished his work on the lathe, the mother and
children have each their particular share in gluing,
pasting, and painting. The material for these articles
are scraps of timber bought out of builders' yards,
the principal tools being the chisel and the lathe.
Pewter toys are made in London in very large
quantities. At one establishment a ton of metal
is consumed each month in the production of Lilliputian
tea, coffee, and dinner sets. English taste
may be gathered from the fact, that the number
of <i>tea</i>-sets made is nearly thirty times larger than
either of the other two. Twenty-three separate
articles make up a set, and of these articles two
millions and a half are made yearly by one house
alone. The metal is provided from miscellaneous
goods, such as old candlesticks, tea-pots, pots and
pans, bought from 'marine' store-dealers by the
hundredweight; and when melted, is formed into
the required shapes by different processes of casting
in moulds. One girl can make two thousand
five hundred small tea-cups in a day. Putting
together the four separate pieces of a mould made
of hard gun-metal, she fills it with the molten
metal, dips its mouth into cold water, takes it to
pieces, and turns out a cup that only wants trimming.</p>

<p>Under the head of paper toys, miniature packs
of cards demand a large amount of material and
labour. It is astonishing to read that one firm
alone in London turns out each year <i>one million</i>
packs of toy cards, using five or six tons of paper
for the purpose, on each sheet of which are
printed three packs in black and red. When
these sheets have been pasted on cards&mdash;called
'middlings'&mdash;one girl can cut up and complete
eight hundred and sixty-four packs each day,
earning about one pound a week. These cards
are sold at twopence, one penny, and a halfpenny
a pack. The penny cards have, as might be
expected, far the largest sale with the public; the
manufacturer getting five shillings for a gross of
twelve dozen, or somewhat less than half the
retail price. Many thousand gross of these little
packs go to all parts of the world. The twopenny
packs are precisely the same as the penny packs,
with the addition of an ornamental paper back to
each card. The demand for these superior packs is
small, for when the price of an article gets above
a penny, we read that it at once shuts it out from
a certain class of the buying public. The purchaser
that will spend more than a penny will spend
sixpence. The spending public, it seems, go in
sets. There is the farthing set, mostly children,
who patronise small shops of toys and sweets;
there is the halfpenny set; and the penny set. We
then jump to the sixpenny set. There is a very
large manufacture of toy picture-books which are
sold at one penny, a halfpenny, and a farthing.
Even the farthing books have a picture on the
cover printed in four colours; and valentines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">{658}</a></span>
printed from wood-blocks and hand-painted can
be sold for a halfpenny.</p>

<p>Another large industry grown up or developed
of late years is the manufacture of india-rubber
toys. The india-rubber, cut up into small pieces,
and formed, by the admixture of white-lead and
other substances, into sheets of a putty-like inelastic
material, is fitted into two pieces of an iron
mould, variously shaped according to the requirements
of the toy, and then plunged into the
vulcanising bath&mdash;a vessel filled with sulphur and
other ingredients. When taken out, the india-rubber
has become elastic, the two pieces of mould
are unscrewed, and the toy, after trimming and
painting, is ready for use.</p>

<p>Toy-boats, which in their construction go through
fifteen different hands, are very cheap, though the
whole of the work is done by hand. In one
London manufactory as many as ten thousand
sailing-boats are made every year; upwards of five
hundred twelve-feet lengths of three-inch deals
being used in their manufacture, and eight tons
of lead being required for their keels.</p>

<p>We have left to the last place notice of the toy
which is the speciality of English toy-makers, the
wax-doll. The wax, after being melted in large
vessels by means of boiling water, is poured into
hollow plaster-moulds made in three pieces, and
laid in rows with the crown of the head downwards.
When the workman has filled from a can
ten or twelve of these moulds, returning to the
first one in the row, he pours back into his can as
much of the wax as remains fluid; and so on with
the other moulds. Most of the wax is thus poured
back again into the can; but that which adheres to
the mould has now become a hollow wax head,
thick or thin according to the time which elapses
between pouring the wax into the mould and
pouring it out again. Then comes the process of
fixing the glass eyes, which, save the very best, are
now made abroad, the Germans having driven the
Birmingham manufacturers out of the field. The
wax ridges left by the joints of the mould are
smoothed down, the surface is brushed over with
turpentine to clean it, and with violet powder to
beautify it; and when the cheeks have been tinted
with rouge and the lips with vermilion, the head
is ready for the hair-dressing operations. For the
best dolls, the wig is made by a lengthy process of
fixing one or two hairs at a time, so as to give a
natural appearance to the hair. In the common
dolls, the hair is more quickly put on in locks.
The black hair, most of which comes from abroad,
is human; but the favourite flaxen curls are of
mohair, the silky wool of the Angora goat. <i>Composition</i>
dolls' heads are made of pasteboard from
iron moulds. The pasteboard is placed over a
mould representing half a head cut vertically
behind the ear, and is then forced by means of a
pestle into every crevice. Another mould for the
other half of the head, is similarly filled; and when
nearly dry, the two halves are removed from the
moulds and pasted together. The head thus
moulded, which becomes as hard as leather, is
coated with a composition of size and whiting,
washed with oil and turpentine; and then having
received a pair of eyes, is dipped into a vessel of
melted wax, and re-dipped until it looks like a solid
wax-head. The wax is then cut from off the eyes,
and scraped from the part of the head which the
hair will cover; and the head is then ready for
painting, powdering, and hair-dressing. A third
class of dolls, known in the trade by the misnomer of
'rag dolls,' is the pretty muslin-faced creature with
blue eyes and becoming cap. Her face is of wax,
covered with an outer skin of muslin, and is made
by pressing a wax mask, moulded in the ordinary
way, into a mould exactly like the one in which
the wax was cast, over which is stretched a piece of
thin muslin. In this way the wax necessarily
adheres so closely to the muslin, that it becomes
a sort of skin to the mask. These faces are nothing
but masks, and require the caps to conceal the junction
with the skulls, made of calico and sawdust,
like the bodies. The bodies are mostly the handiwork
of women and the smaller members of the
doll-maker's family. The doll manufacturer gives
out so many yards of calico which are to produce
so many bodies, the sawdust to be found by the
maker. Then by a division of labour in cutting
out, sewing up, filling with sawdust, and making
the joints, many dozen bodies will be turned out
by one family in a week. The arms are a branch
of the trade upon which certain persons are almost
exclusively employed. They are made of calico
above the elbow, of leather for the part below,
and are paid for at the incredibly small price of
sixpence-halfpenny a dozen pairs; smaller arms for
very cheap dolls costing three-halfpence a dozen
pairs. We read that the hands, which thus cost
each the sixteenth part of a penny, have always a
certain number of fingers! The materials are
found by the makers themselves; so when we
consider that each doll sold to the public for sixpence
should not cost more than threepence in the
making, if the toy-merchant and the retailer are to
earn a living, there remains but a pittance to
be earned by the Caleb Plummers and Jenny
Wrens. Though most dolls leave their first homes
in an undressed condition, the larger establishments
employ many young women in the dressmaking
department of their trade. One article of
dolls' attire forms a distinct branch of trade&mdash;the
little many-coloured leather shoes, which are made
from the waste material left by the makers of
children's ornamental boots and shoes. A thousand
such pairs are made weekly by one large manufactory
in Clerkenwell.</p>

<p>And now we replace our puppets in their box,
grateful for having been let into some of the
mysteries of their creation, not only the more
ready to admire the charming little picture of the
toy-maker, by John Leech, in the <i>Cricket on the
Hearth</i>, but more sensible of a sympathy with doll-nature,
and more certain that toys are as much
needed for old as for young. Happy is it if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">{659}</a></span>
toys of grown-up folks cause as little mischief
and as much pleasure as the innocent toys of
childhood!</p>

<h3>PART II.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Deborah awaked, old Marjory was sitting
watching over her; the sun was still glorious on
the woods outside, but the chamber was left in
grateful gloom. She could not even distinguish
her father's picture; but soon, clear and distinct
through the gloom, laughed out the boyish face
of Charlie. Charlie? What had Charlie done?
Mute and still, Deborah looked up at her old
nurse, while the darkness of reality dawned on
her wakening mind.</p>

<p>'Thou'rt ill, child,' said old Marjory abruptly.</p>

<p>'What makes you think so, dame?' asked
Deborah faintly.</p>

<p>'Why, thy face betrays thee; it is white as my
apron, and thine was a sleep o' sorrow. <i>I</i> know it.
Thou'lt eat summat now, an' no more o' these airs.'</p>

<p>'Have ye no letter or message for me, Marjory?
What are you hiding there?' and Deborah raised
herself in feverish excitement.</p>

<p>'Why, it's a letter that'll keep, I warrant me,
my Lady Deb. It's from the old man at Lincoln.'</p>

<p>'Give it me, Marjory, and leave me, dear old
dame. I wish to be alone.'</p>

<p>So Marjory left her; but soon the old woman
was knocking at the door again with food and
wine for Deborah. She found her sitting on the
floor white as a ghost. 'O child, thou'rt faintin'
for good victuals! There! eat and drink like a
Christian. Why, bless thee, Lady Deb, dear, I
know the master's in his old quandaries. But
don't take on, my Rose.'</p>

<p>'Dame, come and comfort me. Pray, take that
food away! Let me lay my head on thy kind old
breast. Thou'rt a mother to me, Marjory&mdash;always
wert. Dame, I've no dear mother!'</p>

<p>The dame took her darling in her arms, and
rocked her gently to and fro, with the toil-hardened
old hand stroking the girl's silken hair, and her
grave old face laid against it.</p>

<p>'No; thou hast no mother, poor lamb; worse
for thee.'</p>

<p>'It's hard to know right from wrong, Marjory;
but I am quick to decide, and once decided, never
falter. I try to do all for the best.'</p>

<p>'I know it, I know it. But child, my Lady
Deb, have no dealin's with that old man Master
Sinclair. He's a demon.'</p>

<p>'Hush! or give the demon his due, Marjory.
He has been kind to my brother Charlie.'</p>

<p>'For what? We all know it; all Enderby knows
what he's after.'</p>

<p>'That is no concern of Enderby's. I hate this
gossip. Look you, dame, if I choose to wed fifty
such, it is no concern of Enderby's. If I did wed
Master Sinclair, it would be of mine own free
will: let all the world know that!'</p>

<p>'But thou'lt never wed him, dearie!' cried the
old nurse, in tremulous breathless haste.</p>

<p>'I do not answer you Yes or No; but I am my
own mistress.'</p>

<p>'Too much so&mdash;ever too much so,' muttered
Marjory below her breath.</p>

<p>'What say'st thou, Marjory?'</p>

<p>'That thou wantest a strong kind hand over
thee, bein' too headstrong by half. I wish Master
King was here; <i>he'd</i> advise thee!'</p>

<p>'Best not,' said Deborah, with a quick breath
of pain. 'Let "Master King" attend to his own
affairs. Each one has his troubles. Nurse, love
me! I have need of it. O that I were a little
tiny child again, when, in affright or in distress,
I wrapped these arms o' thine about me; and
they would seem to shelter me from all the world!
O that thou wert magician, fairy, to give me my
childhood back! I was happy <i>then</i>.'</p>

<p>'An' not now? What ails my bright bird?
Is it Master Charlie?'</p>

<p>'O Marjory, don't speak of that. Look you at
his picture; look there! Could those fearless eyes
ever turn aside in shame or dread? Would
Charlie, with all his faults, ever bring <i>dishonour</i>
on us? Tell me that?'</p>

<p>'No, <i>never</i>.' The old face turned white, but
did not flinch; Marjory believed in the honour of
her wild boy, as in her own soul.</p>

<p>'Ah, Marjory, nurse, my darling! How I do
love thee! No; never believe that any but a black
liar would ever accuse Charlie Fleming of a mean
low act. Wild, reckless he may be, but dishonourable,
never! Ah, my love, my comfort, our true
and faithful friend, <i>we</i> believe in Charlie Fleming!'</p>

<p>'Where is my boy?' asked the old woman, with
troubled tears in her eyes. 'Why don't he come
to Enderby? They <i>will</i> say strange things o' him
if he don't come home. Oh, he'll break his father's
heart by bein' so wild; but it's his father's blood
that's in him.'</p>

<p>'And his mother's too, for they say our sweet
mother was a mad, mad lass. Dame, who was she?
What was my mother's name?'</p>

<p>The girl gazed straight at the old woman till
Marjory's eyes fell, and the girl's fair face was
flushed with crimson. 'I have never asked you,'
she said, 'not since I was a child; but who was my
mother, dame? Prithee, tell me. Ah, say not
that there was shame! Poor and honest, I care
not; but naught of <i>shame</i>.'</p>

<p>'No, my Lady Deb, no; naught o' shame. She
was the child o' wedded parents, I promise thee;
she was lawful wedded wife, thy mother; but if I
was to tell thee who she was, Sir Vincent would
strike me dead. I cannot tell thee; there's my
faithful promise given, not.'</p>

<p>'I will not ask ye then. One day I will&mdash;must
know. Does Charlie know?'</p>

<p>'Ne'er from me or his father. But no one
knows what Master Charlie knows.'</p>

<p>'There's my father calling me; I must go.
Good-bye, dame. Pray for me.'</p>

<p>Deborah went down into the hall. Sir Vincent
got up and met her. He shut the door carefully,
and led her to a chair; he sat down opposite her,
and screening his face from the light with one
great sinewy hand, gazed out from under its
shadow, as if he would read his daughter's soul.
For her part, she gazed at him with all her great
and tender soul in her eyes, her own despair
forgotten in her father's. There was a long silence
between them, each gazing on the other, sorrow-stricken
and speechless.</p>

<p>'Father,' said Deborah softly then, 'sweet father,
have I not done thee some good? See! here's the
letter from Lincoln; and in three weeks I shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">{660}</a></span>
Master Sinclair's wife. It is my duty, father, my
free choice. My heart is very strong. Sweet father,
thou'rt sad still, ay, even heart-broken; I know
thy face so well! I have saved Charlie. Listen!
This Master Sinclair puts everything in my power,
makes me absolute mistress of all he has. My
first act will be to save us from ruin; Charlie
from ruin too. But tell me what more there is?
What serpent has wronged Charlie falsely? ay,
<i>falsely</i>, for before heaven, father, I would <i>swear</i> that
Charlie has done no dishonour! Sooner would I
doubt my own soul than his. He is incapable of
double-dealing, incapable of all meanness and dishonesty.
To doubt him, to believe for one moment
that he could act dishonourably, is to believe that
Charlie Fleming is no son of thine and mother's;
that this Charlie Fleming is not the boy who has
grown up under thine eyes and mine; graceless,
truly, but the very soul of honour. Even the
masters at his school, his tutors, his comrades who
knew him best, have done him justice in calling
him honourable and true. Then doubt him not for
one moment!'</p>

<p>Under the fire and sweetness of her faith in her
brother, Sir Vincent waxed wan, and his fierce
eyes grew dim with sadness.</p>

<p>Laying one hand upon her hands, and shading
his own face still, he whispered brokenly: 'Believe
on&mdash;hope on. Sweet child, sweet Deb, my
brave best one, I <i>must</i> confide in thee, or my
old heart will break. This boy&mdash;this son, in
whom I trusted&mdash;Ah me!' and with his clenched
hand on his brow and his eyes raised to heaven, the
father gave a deep and bitter sob&mdash;'has <i>betrayed</i>
me&mdash;<i>his father</i>!' With a strange hoarse eager
whisper, and eyes that gleamed like a madman's,
Sir Vincent leaned forward and uttered those
words to Deborah. She, white, still, waited without
a word for more. 'I have seen the papers&mdash;Adam
Sinclair holds them&mdash;by which that boy of mine
has anticipated my death, and raised money upon
Enderby; his writing&mdash;his name&mdash;Charles Stuart
Fleming. Adam Sinclair has got those papers out
of Parry's hands; and by marrying thee, my fairest
and my best, he buys those papers of Parry and
destroys their shameful purport. But Deb&mdash;does
that wipe out the stain? Does that blot out the
fact that that boy of mine, deceiving and betraying
me&mdash;ay, cursing my lengthened life, and
hungering for the old man's death&mdash;has got a
hound to raise this money? Ay, that hound has
in turn betrayed him into Sinclair's hands; and
Charles Fleming's black-heartedness is laid bare to
him and me.'</p>

<p>'Have ye seen those papers, father, with your
very eyes? And Charlie's writing?'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay.'</p>

<p>Deborah panted, terribly white and wild she
looked, with her hands pressed on her side. Sir
Vincent kneeled down beside her and laid his
head upon her shoulder. Bitter, bitter was that
hour.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.</h4>

<p>Some days after that&mdash;it might have been centuries
to Deborah Fleming&mdash;she heard a peal at
the great hall bell; and Kingston Fleming, pale,
disordered in dress, and haggard-eyed, entered the
library. Deborah was looking idly over the books,
not reading; she was stunned, and could neither
read nor write; she scarcely had the power of
thought. One look at King, and she knew that he
knew her fate. 'Deborah!' he said, roughly and
hoarsely, 'you have played me <i>false</i>! By words
strong and binding as an oath, you told your
brother you would not wed Adam Sinclair&mdash;that
no ruin, no misery, should lead you to so ignoble a
sacrifice. Is it then under the mask of doing
good, ye do this grievous evil? Soiling your soul,
sacrificing your life, not to save your father and
your brother, for Charles Fleming would rather see
you dead than accept your bounty <i>then</i>, but to
win rank and money&mdash;to shuffle off this miserable
coil of poverty, that wearies you; and to sell yourself
for gold and tinsel to this hoary reprobate!
No good intention, no amount of self-sacrifice,
could justify so detestable a deed.'</p>

<p>Palely beautiful, but full of calm scorn, Deborah
Fleming faced her fiery and impetuous kinsman;
before she spoke, her haughty eyes flashed fire and
disdain.</p>

<p>'Kingston Fleming, are <i>you</i> my brother? Are
<i>you</i> my guardian, my master, or the master of
this house, that you dare to insult me thus? What
earthly right have you to question or to jeer at me?
Were I a man, I would strike you on the face for
this. Coward! Because I am alone and a woman,
you dare to insult me by these words! What if I
choose to be wed to Adam Sinclair, and to love his
"gold and tinsel;" what is that to you? What if
I choose to "sell" my precious self for his name
and fortune; what is that to you? I have my
father's consent; I am under my father's protection;
you have no earthly claim on me. Fair and
friendly have you ever been to me. Courteous
has been your kindly interest in me from childhood
upwards; but scarcely enough so, to justify
your interference now. I thank you, Master Kingston
Fleming, for your anxiety on my account;
but I'll thank you also to leave me and mine
alone.'</p>

<p>Even in that wild moment, Kingston saw that
she was trembling with fierce passion&mdash;ay, she
could have struck him; in that moment, she
<i>hated</i> him. But Kingston too, goaded by his wild
unavailing remorse and love, mad with the knowledge
of how cruelly his taunt had wronged her,
desperate at her beauty and her sacrifice, cared for
nothing. Dashing down his hat and whip, he
caught her hands in his: 'Beautiful, cruel, heartless,
reckless Deborah! Child, I have loved thee&mdash;too
late, too late. I am <i>free</i>! I am free to
woo thee; I am a free man now! But when I
come in mad haste to ask thy love and pity, I find
thee betrothed, and cast away, and <i>sold</i>! Listen! I
would have <i>made</i> thee love me. No woman on
earth have I loved but Deborah Fleming! I would
have <i>made</i> thee love me!'</p>

<p>Then, with a sharp bitter cry, Deborah wrenched
away her hands. Conscious of her brother's dishonour,
sublime in the greatness of her sacrifice,
and her terrible secret and her suffering, she
looked back on Kingston only with passion and
scorn, to hide the love that would still master her,
and hurled him back taunt for taunt. 'Ah! you
are a good one to preach honour and good faith
to me! throwing over one woman to woo another
who is betrothed! I feel dishonoured even to
have heard your words of love, when I have
plighted troth to Adam Sinclair. But don't think
to win or move me by thy treachery. Deborah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">{661}</a></span>
Fleming doesn't change her troth-plight every
hour. Her vows once made, are binding, binding
till <i>death</i>!'</p>

<p>'Then good-bye, Deborah.' He took up his hat
and whip and strode to the door. His looks were
turned back on her, a smile was in his haggard
eyes&mdash;intense passion, love, and suffering; his face
was pale as death. His last sight of her was the
proud erectness of her figure, and the bright
watchfulness of her beautiful haughty eyes, following
him, and burning on him. But when he was
gone from her sight, the bells of Enderby, as all
through their interview, came clanging wildly out,
clashing on heart and brain.</p>

<p>'I know not if I love or hate him most!' cried
the girl, half mad with her despair. 'I love him,
and I hate him too!'</p>

<p>Then rang out the bells of Enderby, loud and
clear, the refrain, 'I love him, and I hate him
too!' Low in the lull, loud and clear on the gale,
'I love him, and I hate him too!'</p>

<p>Mistress Dinnage in those days was well-nigh
desperate. After hearing that Deborah Fleming
was betrothed to Adam Sinclair and was to be
wedded to him in three weeks' time, she knew
no rest. It was all for Charlie, it was on his
account; Charlie therefore must know of this, and
there would be an end of it. For two evenings
Mistress Dinnage watched for her lover in vain.
She had talked herself hoarse to Deborah; she had
exhausted threats and entreaties: she might as
well have talked to the idle wind&mdash;and so she
knew&mdash;as to Deborah once resolved. On the third
evening-watch, however, Margaret saw the well-known
form. She was out in a moment under
the gloom of the trees and the twilight.</p>

<p>'I have somewhat to tell you, Charlie. Let
me speak quickly and clearly, love. Your sister
Deborah is betrothed to Master Sinclair; they are
to be wedded in two weeks and four days. There
have been sad doings at Enderby. Your father!
Ah! I dare not tell ye what I fear. But oh! grievous
trouble has he been in through tidings from
Master Sinclair about <i>you</i>! So Mistress Deborah
promised then and there to be Master Sinclair's
wife. Oh, I tell you she is desperate since! She
loves another; I know it; but she gives up all
for you and Enderby.'</p>

<p>'Can this be true! Meg, I will kill him first.
Has he betrayed me then? What tidings has he
sent?'</p>

<p>'I know not; but of terrible losses, be sure. Ah,
dear, are ye not in terrible trouble, and waiting
about for love of me? Stay no longer, Charlie!
Think not o' me; I will follow; I've got good
courage. Release sweet Mistress Deborah.'</p>

<p>'How, quotha? Death only will release that
mad reckless girl. Ah! I might have known her.'</p>

<p>'Neither prayers nor commands, Charlie, would
she listen to; no, not if you were rolling in riches
now, she says she would not break her oath.
Charlie! O love, what do I urge you to! You
must fight that old man, and we must fly. Not
to kill him, Charlie, hark ye!&mdash;not to kill him;
but to disable him for what life he has left!
Think me merciless, unwomanly; I care not, so
that it saves her. Or stay, stay, Charlie! Will ye
use all your influence first to turn him? O ye can
talk to tenderness a heart o' stone! Talk to Adam
Sinclair then till he melts to pity; but set sweet
Deborah free!'</p>

<p>'<i>Talk</i> to him!' said Charlie Fleming, with a
short laugh; 'ay, I will <i>talk</i>. But we have old
accounts to settle first, old debts to square. We
have a little affair to settle between ourselves,
Adam Sinclair and I. Hark ye, Meg! He has
accused me of foul play&mdash;not to my face, not he!
but behind my back. He has accused me of cheating
at cards&mdash;a dirty trick to brand on a man; and
as ye know, love, whatever Charlie Fleming's
faults, he would scorn so foul an act. I don't
mind telling ye now, Meg, that I must wipe off
this slander with blood. All my comrades are up
in arms at it; and even <i>now</i> I am on my way
to Lincoln, to meet Adam Sinclair face to face;
and in case I fall, Meg&mdash;to bid thee now farewell.'
He took her in his arms; he folded back
the long dark hair from the passionate face.
In bitter wrath and passion had she trembled at
hearing of the foul slander put on his fair fame;
and her fiery spirit, following the spirit of his
words, had made her grasp his hands, and pant
and frown in eagerness for revenge. But when
she pictured him dead&mdash;lying perchance beneath
the old man's deadly shot, stiffening in his blood,
in the perished glory of his youth and strength&mdash;then
her woman's heart began to shudder and to
faint: she leaned on his broad breast and moaned.</p>

<p>'What! sick?' he whispered. 'Faint? A
little <i>poltroon</i>! The wife of a Fleming must be
brave. <i>Thou</i> wouldst hate and despise Charles
Fleming if he could for one moment brook such
an insult as this. Come; I meant to bid thee
good-bye, and hide this from thee; but now
I have told thee all, thou must face death with
me, and take it as it comes.'</p>

<p>'I know it! I know it! Not for one moment
would I say aught but "Go!" Yet, pity my
woman's fears; think how long I have loved but
thee! Ay, I have kissed the stones where thy
shadow passed! and to lose thee now, <i>now</i>&mdash;my
husband of but a week, my darling <i>husband</i>! Nay;
I will not grieve before 'tis time!' she cried with
sudden fire, gazing up at him. 'See! I am so brave
that I would fain be thy second, and see thy true
shot speed to that old coward heart! Oh, thou'lt
kill him, Charlie, thou'lt kill him, or hurt him
sorely. A dead-shot he may be; but men say
thine is deadlier. Nay; do not laugh; I have
listened, till I know better than thou canst know
thyself, all Charles Fleming's brave gifts. They
say thou'rt a deadly shot.'</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her. 'A deadly shot!
Yes; I will shoot him for love of <i>thee</i>. Better not
mangle the old traitor; I will kill him clean, or
not at all. Thank heaven, if he kills me it will be
clean! Love, if I fall, don't weep; <i>I leave a hope
with thee</i>.' These words were whispered; she did
not answer, she did not speak.</p>

<p>A few more happy stolen hours, and he was
gone. She went with him to the gate in the
woods, where he was wont to come and go,
through the mossed entrance and the tangled
clambering ivy. There they stood, her hand upon
the gate; her dark head, that reached no higher
than his heart, laid there. The mute clinging
hand did not escape him; every motion, every
gesture of his young love, was marked by his
keen hawk eyes, as if it were her last. He pulled
open the stubborn gate; still the two clung as if
they would never part.</p>

<p>'Sweet love, good-bye.' He listened for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">{662}</a></span>
answer, but only heard a sob; kisses were Margaret's
good-bye&mdash;kisses, and the deathless love
within them. Then her arms fell asunder, and
leaning against the gate, she let him go. With the
iron grasped within her little hands, she stood
gazing through the bars and saw him wave adieu;
still stood, while the quick hoofs bore him far
away; still stood, gazing for him through the
night, though Mistress Margaret Fleming (for
Mistress Fleming indeed she was) saw him no
more!</p>

<h2><a name="COD-FISHING_IN_ICELAND" id="COD-FISHING_IN_ICELAND">COD-FISHING IN ICELAND.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> the French are not naturally a maritime
nation, there is a hardy race of fishermen to be
found on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany,
from whose ranks are obtained a large proportion
of the hands that are employed in the cod-fishing
of Newfoundland and Iceland. Though it is a
painful and dangerous occupation, there are few
that offer a higher remuneration to the masters
and crews; the shoals of fish are inexhaustible,
and the demand is always greater than the supply.</p>

<p>It is, however, not always easy to get up the
necessary complement of hands; and captains
sometimes have recourse to the unlawful acts of
the press-gang of former days. A ship ready
to start will enter a little creek on the coast of
Brittany near an almost unknown village; and
after mass on Sunday, the captain announces at
the church door that he is in want of men for
Iceland. The advantages are loudly proclaimed:
good food, good wine, brandy, meat three times a
week, and above all, an immediate bounty of from
four to eight pounds, with future pay in proportion
to the results. The extreme poverty of
the peasants makes such a sum of money seem
fabulous; they have only to say Yes. And yet,
how hard it is to them to leave their beloved home
and speak the fatal word! The captain knows
how to overcome their irresolution. Installed in a
neighbouring <i>cabaret</i>, he patiently waits until some
young and vigorous men enter, when he pours
forth all his eloquence, enumerates the advantages,
slurs over the danger and fatigue, shakes the
gold in his purse, orders an abundance of cider
and brandy, and in the end, draws his victims into
the net.</p>

<p>The engagement is signed; and the labourer,
who has spent the winter in collecting sea-weed for
the fields and sowing his crops, leaves the women
to manage the rest. All being favourable, he will
return in September with twenty pounds in his
pocket. A few voyages make him a good sailor,
when he can be drafted into the fleet at Cherbourg,
thence to be transformed into a servant of his
country.</p>

<p>From the difficulty of obtaining men, French
shipbuilders reduce the labour by mechanical
appliances; so that five or six men will navigate
ships of two hundred tons. But in cod-fishing
craft it is necessary to have as many men as possible,
and twenty are usually taken. The arrangements
are wofully insufficient. There are only
sleeping-places for a third; one sailor resting
whilst two are fishing. Thus, after six hours spent
on deck without shelter from rain, wind, and snow,
the waves washing over and the heavy line in
their hands, the men go down stiff with cold and
worn out with fatigue. Yet they must lie dressed
as they are, on a hard damp mattress; and frequently
the clothes are never changed from the
beginning to the end of the voyage.</p>

<p>After five voyages a man is authorised to take
the command, and though styled captain, he is
nothing more than the head of the fishermen. It
is his work to keep the account of the number of
cod caught; the sailors taking care as they hook
a fish to cut out its tongue and place it in a bag
hung to their belt. When the hour of repose comes
the tongues are taken to the captain, and about
ten centimes is allowed for each. The second in
office is only chosen as being the most skilful with
his line; then comes the man who cuts off the cods'
heads, opens and prepares the fish for the salter;
and lastly the one who lays them in the barrels
and closes them for sale.</p>

<p>With this short description of the crew we will
pass over the voyage, as described by a French
writer, M. Aragon, and take the reader to the Icelandic
coast, Patrix-Fiord, where a number of
vessels are already collected. Deserted during the
past season, it now presents a scene of the greatest
animation. A man-of-war is there to provide for
any repairs that may be needed; carpenters and
blacksmiths are busy doing their work, the bay
echoes with the noise of hammers and saws. Other
vessels, called <i>chasseurs</i>, come from France to take
away the fish. On the shore rises the little wooden
hut of the <i>cocman</i>, a Danish merchant who lives
there during the summer months to trade with the
people and sell spirits. No night comes on to
interrupt the incessant labour; during the middle
of May the sun is never below the horizon, and but
a few stars may be seen on the zenith about the
end of June.</p>

<p>Those ships that have chosen their position for
fishing take down their sails and lie as quietly at
anchor as the wind will permit, the men standing
in a close line at the side of the vessel. They are
clothed from head to foot in knitted or flannel
garments, with waterproof capes and hats. A
petticoat of strong linen is tied round the waist,
descending below the knees, and to preserve the
feet from wet they wear woollen stockings and
waterproof boots. Thick woollen gloves lined
with leather save their hands from the injury of
constant friction from the heavy line. The whole
forms a curious picture of ragged, patched, greasy,
well-tarred habiliments, which a comic pencil
might rejoice to portray. The men, indifferent
to their appearance, seek only to be saved from
moisture. The lines they use are necessarily very
heavy to bring on board a fish weighing say
forty pounds. There are two hooks baited with
the entrails of fish; but the voracity of the cod
is such that it is scarcely necessary to be too
particular as to the lure. Thus the men stand for
six hours consecutively, gently moving the line,
and when a shake indicates a catch, lifting the
heavy weight on board.</p>

<p>The fatigue is very great, and much of it is pure
loss, as the line too often brings up another fish,
called the flétan, which though very good to eat,
does not bear preserving. The sailors hold this
interloper in extreme aversion, as it often breaks
the line by its weight, and gives them much
trouble to heave on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">{663}</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now take a glance at the scenery which
surrounds these hardy seamen. The coast is
broken up into large gulfs, strewn with shoals
and reefs of a most dangerous character, where
misfortunes are so frequent that the place is called
by the fishermen 'The Ships' Cemeteries.' Enormous
precipices line the coast, with heaps of volcanic
stones, worn by the action of the waves, lying
at the foot. These rocks are cut at certain distances
into spaces like the mouth of an immense river,
called fiords, which communicate with the sea by a
comparatively narrow inlet, and spread out into a
sort of lake, surrounded by vertical and jagged rocks.
The more sinuous the outlet, the more sure is the
anchorage; and in each bay there is generally
found one sandy spit, forming a sort of natural
jetty, behind which the ships are secure, and
where the cocman builds his hut. Far away in
the distance rises the gigantic cone of the extinct
volcano Sneffiels-J&#339;kul, whose summit is covered
with rosy-tinted snow. In the hollows of the rocks
thousands of sea-birds build their nests, to be
slaughtered by the inhabitants at a certain season
for the sake of <i>fuel</i>, their flesh being utterly
unpalatable to the least fastidious appetite.</p>

<p>One of the most important fiords is the Dyre-Fiord,
where a small hamlet of a dozen huts or
<i>b&#339;rs</i> is built in a large meadow. These constructions
are not easy to describe; they are low
and massive, formed of lava-stone and peat. To
avoid cold and damp within, a very small door
opens into a dark narrow passage, towards which
the rooms converge. The walls and pointed roof
are covered with turf, upon which grows a thick
crop of grass, making it very difficult to distinguish
the <i>b&#339;r</i> from the field in which it stands.
Within, the accommodation is most simple&mdash;a
kitchen and one sleeping-apartment, with closets
to contain provisions, clothes, and fishing apparatus.
Beyond the vegetable garden is a building
for drying fish, the planks of which are separated
to admit the free circulation of the air. Here the
decapitated cod are hung, emitting a savour far
from pleasant. The heads form the food of the
Icelanders with butter and milk; the fish are sold
for export. The sea-wolf is also largely eaten,
though its flesh is tough and rancid, the frequency
of leprosy and elephantiasis in the island being
attributed to this unwholesome diet.</p>

<p>Men and women, masters and servants, all inhabit
the same room, whilst cleanliness is not
much attended to; but poor as they are, and
accustomed to great privations, they set an example
of cheerful contentment. The beauty of
the young girls is remarkable; their fair hair falls
in long plaits, partially covered by a black cloth
coif, daintily worn on one side of the head, and
finished at the top with a tassel of coloured silk
run through a silver or steel buckle, which floats
on the shoulder. It reminds the traveller of the
Greek head-dress; but the blue eyes with their
sweet benevolent expression soon recall to his
mind their Danish origin. The dress is made of
the cloth woven in the country, and on festival
days the bodice is gaily adorned with silver
braid and velvet, whilst the belt and sleeves are
ornamented with silver devices, beautifully chased
and often of great value. On wet and cold days
the shawl becomes a useful mantilla, completely
enveloping the head, and defending the wearer
from the effects of the frequent storms.</p>

<p>The people offer the most generous and cordial
hospitality to all travellers, and especially to shipwrecked
mariners. An opportunity for proving
this hospitality once occurred in the open and
dangerous bay of the Westre-Horn, surrounded
by breakers and reefs. Here forty vessels were
fishing on a fine morning in March, when the
breeze began to freshen. The cod was abundant,
and the men were tempted to stay too near the
coast. All the vessels but five doubled the point;
these beaten back by the enormous waves, and not
daring to raise a sail, were broken on the rocks.
Thirty men reached the shore, sixty-six found
a watery grave. The <i>Sea-bird</i> struggled long, until
breaking up, all perished excepting the mate and
cabin-boy; the former had received a severe
wound in the leg by falling on some broken
glass. Tied to the rigging, together they awaited
their fate, frozen with cold, the waves washing
over them. After three hours the boy expired of
exhaustion; and the mate unloosing the ropes was
soon thrown on to the shore. The corpses of his
friends were lying around him, the survivors
having gone inland for shelter; but with great
difficulty he followed them, crossing streams and
marshes, sinking into ice and snow at every step,
his wounded leg torn by the sharp points. Six
weary hours were thus passed, when his heartrending
cries at length reached two Icelanders,
who carried him into a <i>b&#339;r</i> not far off.</p>

<p>For five months these good people nursed and
tended the sufferer. At the end of that time he
was still confined to bed, but the healing had
begun. A vessel was sent round to bring him
away; yet his hosts evinced much sorrow at the
prospect of his departure. At their request the
captain left him one night longer, when the shipwrecked
mariner was escorted to the beach by the
whole family, all manifesting a deep emotion.
After thanking the father, not only for his care of
the survivor, but also for the burial he had given
to the victims of the storm, the captain assured
him that the French government would indemnify
him for the expense he had incurred; but the
good man only pressed his hand, declaring that he
had done his duty, and deserved neither indemnity,
thanks, nor recompense. The Minister of Marine
sent a gold medal to him after hearing of his
generous conduct.</p>

<p>Robbery, murder, and theft are almost unknown
in this peaceful little country; not a soldier or
policeman is needed even in the capital Reikiavik;
a fact which fully proves the virtues of the Icelanders.
Travellers have asserted that the hospitality
was not quite so disinterested as it appears,
and there may be an exception in certain localities,
such as the road to the Geysers, traversed every
year by many tourists. Here the Lutheran ministers
offer shelter in their churches, which are
transformed into hotels, and provide fish, milk, and
coffee for those who need it at a certain charge.
Roads are almost unknown; the configuration of
the ground wholly prevents their formation. The
island has been the scene of such tremendous
volcanic action that the mountains are heaped
together in the most fantastic manner. From
the glaciers which cover the summits of extinct
volcanoes rush torrents of water, bringing down
the disintegrated rocks to accumulate in the
valleys below.</p>

<p>Yet in the midst of these convulsions, Nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">{664}</a></span>
does not forget her rights, and wherever a little
earth can be found there grows a tuft of grass.
Meadows undulating with the rocky ground cover
it with a green mantle, and in summer the botanist
will find most of the wild-flowers which bloom in
our temperate climates. During the winter, the
water infiltrating through the soil turns the whole
into an impassable marsh, where the unwary
traveller may sink into quicksands of the most
dangerous character, since there is no exterior sign
to denote their existence. In a country whose
natural configuration scarcely admits of carriage-roads,
ponies are invaluable, their robust constitution
defying alike climate and fatigue. Small in
size, quiet and patient, they resemble the Corsican
or Pyrenean breed. Such is their docility, that the
most inexperienced rider may mount without fear,
and trust to their instinct in the difficult mountain
passes. Three or four thousand are exported
yearly into England, where they are used chiefly
for coal-mines; and such is the estimation in
which they are now held, that their cost has
largely increased.</p>

<p>The eider-duck is one of the most profitable
sources of revenue, and strict laws prevent their
wanton destruction. A gun is not allowed to be
fired near the places they frequent, for fear of
alarming them; thus they have become so tame
that they allow themselves to be stroked without
fear. They choose the islands for their homes&mdash;where
their deadly enemy the fox cannot reach
them&mdash;and the steep barren rocks in the fiords.
Many of the owners clear a thousand a year by
the sale of the down, without any expense. It is
scarcely necessary to make laws for the preservation
of game, since shooting is a pleasure the
Icelanders wholly despise. The curlew, snipe,
golden plover, and wild-duck abound, as well
as the delicate white partridge; but the natives
despise them as food, and prefer smoked or dried
salmon, with which their streams abound.</p>

<p>In the middle of August the greater part of
the French ships meet in the Faskrud-Fiord before
starting home. By this time the snow is beginning
to fall and ice to form around the bays. Detached
icebergs make their appearance in forms as singular
as varied, sometimes resembling fantastic animals
or the prow of a ship. The anchors are raised,
and the convoy leaves the wintry shore; and
anticipations of home once more dawn on the
weary fishermen.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;COMING-HOME.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparations</span> for the much-talked-of marriage
are pushed on rapidly; and before the spring
flowers are making the slopes of Hayes Hill glad
with their brightness, the wedding&mdash;a very quiet
one&mdash;takes place. Laura Best is not present, though
everybody says how charmingly she has acted
towards Katie. She called on the bride-elect, and
on the wedding morning a short perfumy note of
congratulation and a handsome set of opals arrive
as a marriage gift. Sir Herbert is pleased at his
daughter's attentions to his bride, and is glad that
after all such a friendly feeling has sprung up
between them.</p>

<p>The fact is, Laura Best, finding that opposition
cannot prevent the marriage, has decided to give it
her apparent sanction. Not for worlds would she
interfere with the happiness of the wedded pair
or throw unpleasantness on their path. So she
quietly does all that is needful in the way of
proper attention, and then goes home to Hayes
Hill to her children and duties there. Yet in
secret she bears a heavy heart with her, and
mourns over her father's infatuation.</p>

<p>If the Admiral's wedding has been a quiet
one, the home-coming is destined to be quite the
reverse. The whole town of Seabright wakes up,
and great preparations are made to welcome the
pair. The ships in the bay are illuminated, flags
flutter in the breeze, and bells peal out their
jubilant chimes.</p>

<p>Katie smiles proudly to herself as she walks
through the lofty apartments of Government
House, and feels she is mistress there now. It is
pleasant to roam about everywhere, and know that
she has the right to do so; pleasant also to stand in
the shade of the deep window, and listen to the
joyous pealing of the bells, which she knows are
pealing for her. Wealth and rank are in her
grasp; she has entered on the honours of her new
position, and will rule with no timid hand. Self-confident
and fearless, she laughs to herself in
utter exultation at the warnings, the croakings, the
forebodings that a while ago assailed her. Walter
Reeves is very angry indeed, when he finds out
how unceremoniously he has been set aside; and
he is intensely bitter against Katie in the first
flush of his disappointment; so doubtless it is
fortunate for all concerned that his ship, the <i>Leo</i>, is
ordered off on a cruise in the Mediterranean. He
will be away for nearly twelve months, and surely
in that time the most poignant heart-wound may
be healed. Besides, change of scene is all-potent
in such cases!</p>

<p>As months pass away, Lady Dillworth's tastes
rapidly expand and assert themselves; ere long
she becomes the leader of society in Seabright, and
the most fashionably dressed woman there. Sir
Herbert is generous beyond measure; Katie must
not have a wish ungratified, or a desire unfulfilled
if he can help it. And so the young wife, loving
admiration and homage with a wild passion, basks
in them to her heart's content. The semi-official
parties at Government House, stately and dignified
as they were, rapidly give place to balls and quadrille
assemblies, to late hours and overcrowded
rooms. The junior officers of the ships rejoice at
the change; while the older ones shake their
heads ominously, and gradually withdraw themselves
from excitements that have no longer any
charms for them.</p>

<p>Lady Dillworth is the belle on all occasions.
Whether she entertains the company with her rich
voice as she sings for them, or delights them with
her sparkling conversation, or whirls with some
favoured ones through waltz or galop, she is ever
the attraction of the evening.</p>

<p>If the Admiral sometimes thinks there is rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">{665}</a></span>
too much gaiety, and longs to have Katie now and
then all to himself, he does not say so, for he
cannot bear to deprive her of any enjoyment on
which her heart is set. Often and often during
the season, at Katie's old home, sounds of the
rattle of carriages come up to the cosy drawing-room,
and the lamps flash for a moment on the
blinds.</p>

<p>'There they go&mdash;another party at Government
House, I suppose!' Mr Grey will say, as he quietly
looks up from his books.</p>

<p>'Yes, my dear; Katie is giving a ball to-night,
and such a magnificent dress she has got for it!
Sir Herbert grudges her nothing.'</p>

<p>'So much the worse for Katie. Spending is an
art easily learned; and where in the world <i>she</i>
gained her education on that point, I am puzzled
to know. Not from you, Sarah; you were always
economical.'</p>

<p>'Katie's position is different from ours, dear; she
must keep it up.'</p>

<p>'But she has no need to keep up such an endless
whirl. I wonder the Admiral is not tired to death
of it. <i>I</i> should be, I know.'</p>

<p>And so, all through the quiet night, husband
and wife are roused every now and then from
their slumbers by the rattle of passing wheels;
and Mrs Grey sighs to herself about Katie's love
for excitement, but will not blame her aloud, even
to her husband's ears.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;RETURN OF THE 'LEO.'</h3>

<p>December comes round again with its blustering
winds and rude gales; there is every prospect of a
spell of rough weather, and Captain Walter Reeves
looks with intense satisfaction at his gallant ship
the <i>Leo</i>, again riding securely at her anchor in
Seabright Bay.</p>

<p>A season on shore just now, when festivities are
about to commence, is in his idea far preferable
to being tossed about on a squally sea or cruising
about from port to port; so he congratulates
himself on being ordered home. He hears of the
gay doings at Government House, and how Katie
is the reigning belle of Seabright; and he listens
placidly, without one throb of emotion. Time has
proved a panacea. He has no pang of regret that
Sir Herbert is the husband of this very attractive
woman of fashion, instead of himself. As a matter
of duty, he is on his way to call at Government
House, when outside a fashionable shop in one
of the streets he sees a well-appointed carriage
drawn up, and in it he catches a glimpse of a
well-known form and face. An obsequious shopman
is standing on the edge of the curb-stone displaying
some articles of bijouterie; a coachman in
dark livery, with a black cockade in his hat, is
holding the reins. It <i>is</i> Lady Dillworth. There is
no mistaking her imperial manner, as she speaks
out in that slightly commanding voice; neither
is there any mistaking her handsome face, her
brilliant eyes, her dark coronal of hair, as she sits
there in her proud beauty. Walter, as he crosses
the street, takes note of her velvet, her sealskin,
and the feathers and the damask rosebuds in her
bonnet, and thinks all this suits the Admiral's
wife very well. He hears her say to the shopman:
'The price is eight guineas, you say. Are the
stones real?'</p>

<p>'Yes, my Lady; and they are very fine and well
set. You are the first to whom I have had the
honour of shewing them.'</p>

<p>'Send one of them to Government House. Or
stay,' adds she musingly&mdash;'I want another for a
present for a friend; so you may send me two
bouquet-holders.'</p>

<p>'Sixteen guineas for such rubbish as that! I'm
very glad the money comes out of the Admiral's
purse, and not out of mine. A poor Commander's
exchequer would not stand many such attacks as
that,' thinks Walter, rather ungallantly, as he now
greets the occupant of the carriage.</p>

<p>Katie is surprised to see him, and says so as she
holds out her daintily gloved hand. 'I had no
idea the <i>Leo</i> had returned. Have you been long
here?'</p>

<p>'I arrived only last night, and am on my way to
Government House.'</p>

<p>'How unfortunate there is no one at home! Sir
Herbert went to Belton Park this morning, and I
am on my way to the station to meet a friend who
is coming to stay with me. By-the-by, you know
the young lady&mdash;Liddy Delmere. Do you remember
her?'</p>

<p>'Isn't she very pretty and a blonde?'</p>

<p>'Yes; she has both those attractions.'</p>

<p>'And doesn't she sing nicely?'</p>

<p>'O yes! Liddy can sing if she likes; and her
voice is not a bad soprano,' replies Lady Dillworth
with one of her brightest smiles.</p>

<p>'Then I'm sure I've often met her at your
house in former days.'</p>

<p>'You had better come and refresh your memory
this evening. We shall be quite alone, and very
pleased to see you at Government House.'</p>

<p>Captain Reeves is of course delighted to meet
Lady Dillworth on such friendly terms. He
accepts the impromptu invitation at once.</p>

<p>The past, with its shadows and disappointments
and jealousies, is gone for ever. Better now to
banish every recollection of it from his heart, and
meet Katie on an entirely new footing.</p>

<p>As if by tacit understanding, they both decide
this is the wisest plan. They meet and separate
as mere every-day acquaintances. Nothing can be
more unembarrassed than her ladyship's smile
as she acknowledges Walter's parting bow, and
drives off, to the admiration of the staring urchins
in the street.</p>

<p>'Quite alone' is a mere relative term with Lady
Dillworth; for when the footman throws open the
drawing-room door on that evening to announce
Captain Reeves, the latter sees the room is already
half full of guests. Katie stands near the piano;
her dark velvet dress falls in sweeping folds, unbroken
by flounce or trimming; the beautiful set
of opals&mdash;her step-daughter's wedding present&mdash;shine
out with a subdued light from neck, arms,
and breast. Beside her is Liddy Delmere, who in
her bright blue silk dress, and with her sunny hair
tied with ribbons of the same azure tint, forms a
contrast to her hostess, in which neither loses.</p>

<p>Ere long, Walter finds himself seated beside Miss
Delmere, for they have renewed their acquaintanceship
with mutual satisfaction, and plunge at
once into discursive recollections of the past.</p>

<p>'We had some pleasant times together in the
days long ago,' begins Walter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">{666}</a></span></p>

<p>'O yes; I remember meeting you several times
at Mrs Grey's, also at a picnic on Bushby Plain,
and at a gipsy party. Hadn't we capital fun
sometimes?'</p>

<p>'Yes, really. What a pity these happy days are
over. We never can recall those bright fresh
hours, when the heart gilds everything with a
magic glamour.'</p>

<p>'Speak for yourself, Captain Reeves! For <i>my</i>
part, I enjoy things as much as ever I did; and
my heart "gilds" a good deal still. Do tell me
some of your adventures. What have you been
doing all the months you were away?'</p>

<p>'Nothing worth relating. I neither discovered
a desert island nor a new race of savages. I really
have no wonders to narrate.'</p>

<p>'How marvellous! The very lack of incidents
makes the thing curious. Now, if <i>I</i> had
been cruising about in the <i>Leo</i> for months, I should
have gleaned materials enough for at least two
volumes of travels.'</p>

<p>'Ah! you ladies draw largely on the imagination.
My experience is just this: I went away
from England last spring; I return again in time
for the Christmas pudding.'</p>

<p>'You sailors are all alike. I never met one yet
who could give me the merest sketch of his voyage&mdash;all
seems a blank, but the going and returning,'
Liddy asserts laughingly.</p>

<p>'We had some nice balls at Malta,' replies
Walter, rousing himself with a sudden recollection.</p>

<p>'Had you? Who gave them?'</p>

<p>'Sometimes <i>we</i> did; and crowds of the prettiest
girls I ever saw, came.'</p>

<p>'Very flattering to the givers.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I wish you could see the <i>Auberge de Provence</i>
when it is made ready for a ball; it looks
just like a fairy scene. The old knights of Provence
would never recognise the place if they
could return to take a peep at it. As one passes
through the hall, it appears like an orange grove;
the trees are full of golden fruit and fragrant
blossoms; and clusters of coloured lamps shine
out like rubies through the green leaves.'</p>

<p>Walter is fairly launched into his subject now;
one recollection speedily calls up another, till
Liddy and he grow eloquent, and enjoy themselves
amazingly.</p>

<p>He begins describing some musical charades
they 'got up' at Malta.</p>

<p>'How nice they must be! But I can't quite
understand them.'</p>

<p>'We merely take a word, divide it, and make
our singing descriptive of the parts, instead of
acting them out. For instance, take Ravenswood.'</p>

<p>'A sweet word, particularly if one has to croak
out a raven chorus! Oh, I should like that
extremely!' laughs Liddy.</p>

<p>'Ah, no; you don't catch my meaning. We
make quite a grand affair of it, have a drop-scene,
on which birds and trees are painted, and our
illustrations are from the opera of <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i>.'</p>

<p>'Quite a musical drama on a small scale, I
declare! I wish we could get up something of the
sort here. I'll ask Lady Dillworth about it. And
here she comes.'</p>

<p>Katie walks over, looking rather amused at
the evident good understanding between Liddy
and Walter, as they thus interchange recollections
with much <i>empressement</i>. She seats herself
beside them, and the subject is discussed in all
its points. Lady Dillworth enters into it with
impulsive eagerness. Already she is longing for
something new and fresh, something that will
cause a sensation among the 'upper ten' at Seabright.</p>

<p>Several other guests join them, and ere long an
animated group of people are professing willingness
to aid such a charming scheme; anything
novel is so attractive to those whose whole life
is excitement. Walter takes the initiative at
once.</p>

<p>'I have all the music we need. The bandmaster
of the 25th arranged it for me with the
songs, duets, and choruses. It's capital for
drawing-room practice, if we can only get enough
performers.'</p>

<p>Everybody is ready to join, so the <i>rôle</i> is
settled on the spot. Walter is to be Edgar; Liddy,
Lucy Ashton. But here the young lady enters a
protest.</p>

<p>'I don't wish to be Lucy. If you want me, you
must let me be Lucy's mother. I make a splendid
old woman.'</p>

<p>'Then who will be the unfortunate bride?&mdash;Will
you, Lady Dillworth?' asks Major Dillon, turning
towards her.</p>

<p>'O yes, if Miss Delmere objects.'</p>

<p>So it is settled. Walter infects the whole party
with his eagerness. Scenes, music, costumes, and
arrangements are talked over; and Katie is all
anxiety to carry out the plans with due effect.
Walter is to bring on shore the music-scroll and
sketches of the costume; and the intended performers
are invited to meet him to-morrow morning
at Government House, for the first rehearsal.</p>

<p>'Now <i>that</i> affair is settled, we'll have some
music,' Katie says, as she rises and goes towards
the piano. Walter follows her. 'Have you forgotten
all your songs, Captain Reeves?'</p>

<p>'O no. How could I? <i>You</i> taught me most
of them,' he replies.</p>

<p>'Will you try one now?'</p>

<p>'Don't ask me to sing a solo. I should break
down at once; but if you will allow me to join you
in a duet, I'll try to manage it.'</p>

<p>Katie turns over a book of manuscript music,
and they fix on <i>Then and Now</i>.</p>

<p>'The words are dreadfully stupid, but the air is
pretty,' asserts Lady Dillworth, as she runs over
the prelude:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We heard the tower bells pealing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On that soft summer night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your hand was linked with mine, love;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your heart, like mine, was light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We whispered low together<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of that hope and of this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While far above, the joyous bells<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seemed echoes of our bliss.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again those bells are pealing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We hear them now, and sigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer can their chimes, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Blend with our thoughts of joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our lives for aye are parted;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And on the wintry air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those crashing sounds but haunt us now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like echoes of despair.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The two voices ring harmoniously and plaintively
through the rooms. One could almost imagine
the singers are actually using the 'past to give
pathos' to the words. But nothing is further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">{667}</a></span>
from their thoughts. Katie is only deciding that,
after all, Walter's voice will 'do' with hers in the
duets of the charade; and Walter is wishing&mdash;just
a little&mdash;that Miss Delmere had retained the part
of Lucy, as at first proposed.</p>

<h2><a name="ELECTRICITY_AS_A_LIGHT-PRODUCER" id="ELECTRICITY_AS_A_LIGHT-PRODUCER">ELECTRICITY AS A LIGHT-PRODUCER.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has long been the opinion of scientific people
that in electricity we have a power the development
of which is only at present in its infancy.
The marvellous details of our telegraphic system
constantly remind us that there is a mysterious
fluid round about us which can to a certain extent
be made subservient and obedient to the will of
man. This familiarity with that which would a
few centuries ago have been stigmatised as the
outcome of sorcery, has led the ignorant to place a
blind belief in its powers. The subtle fluid has in
fact taken the place of the necromancer's wand,
and is believed by many to be capable of anything
or everything. The electrician is thus credited
with much that does not of right belong to his
domain, and the wildest speculations are occasionally
indulged in as to what next he will do for us.
That electricity will prove of far more extended
use than the present state of knowledge allows, we
all have vague anticipations, and among these is
the reasonable hope that it will some day supersede
coal-gas as a means of artificial illumination. We
propose, by a brief review of the present position
of electrical research, to point out how far such a
hope is justified by facts.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy was the first to discover
that when the terminal wires of a powerful electric
battery were furnished with carbon-points and
brought into such a position that they almost
touched, the space between them became bridged
over with a dazzling arc of light. The excessive
cost of producing this light (owing to the
rapid consumption of the metal-plates and acids
which together form the battery-power) rendered
it for a long time almost inapplicable to any other
purpose than that of lecture-room demonstration.
But it was evident to all that a means of illumination
so nearly approaching in its intensity the light
of the sun, would, if practicable, be of immense
value to society at large. Apart from its cost,
there were many other hindrances to its ready
adoption. The incandescent carbon-points&mdash;which
we may here remark are cut from a hard form of
gas-coke&mdash;were found to waste away unequally.
Some plan had therefore to be hit upon of not
only replacing them at certain intervals, but also,
in view of this inequality of consumption, of preserving
their relative distance the one from the
other; otherwise the light they gave became intermittent
and irregular. These difficulties were met
by employing clock-work as a regulator, and more
recently by a train of wheelwork and magnets set
in motion by the current itself. These arrangements
naturally led to complications, which required
the constant supervision of skilled operators,
and the coveted light was necessarily confined
to uses of a special nature where the question
of cost and trouble was unimportant.</p>

<p>The use of the battery for the electric light has
for some years been almost entirely superseded by
the magneto-electric machine. The construction
of this machine is based upon Faraday's discovery,
that when a piece of soft iron inclosed in a coil of
metal wire is caused to pass by the poles of a
magnet, an electric current is produced in the wire.
The common form of this machine consists of a
number of such iron cores so arranged upon a
revolving cylinder that in continual succession
they fly past a number of stationary horse-shoe
magnets placed in a frame round its circumference.
By a piece of mechanism called a commutator, the
various small streams of electricity thus induced
are collected together into one powerful current.
This invention forms one of the most advanced
steps in the history of the electric light. But
although it produces electricity without the consumption
of metal involved in the battery system,
another element of cost comes into view in the
expense of the steam-power necessary to work it;
besides which the original outlay is considerable.</p>

<p>In the year 1853 a Company was formed at
Paris for producing (by the aid of some large
magneto-electric machines) gas for combustion, by
the decomposition of water. The Company failed
to produce gas, and what was perhaps more
to the annoyance of the subscribers, they failed
also to shew any dividends, and the expensive
machines were voted impostors. However, an
Englishman, Mr Holms, succeeded in turning
them to better account, and eventually produced
by their aid a light of great power. Mr Wilde of
Manchester was another worker in the same field;
and improved machines were soon introduced to
public notice by both gentlemen. A few years
after, the South Foreland and Dungeness lighthouses
were provided with experimental lights.
(The first-named headland had previously been
furnished with an oxyhydrogen or lime light, a
source of illumination which is also open to the
same objections of requiring constant attention and
renewal.)</p>

<p>It is a matter of surprise to most visitors to the
South Foreland lighthouse to find that a small
factory and staff of men are necessary to keep the
electric apparatus in working order. The extent
of the establishment is partly explained by the
fact that, in case of a breakdown of any part of the
apparatus, everything is kept in duplicate. Hence
there are two ten horse-power steam-engines, and a
double set of magneto-electric machines, although
only half that number are in actual use at one
time. The old oil-lamps are also kept ready, in
view of the improbable event of both sets of
electrical apparatus going wrong.</p>

<p>Although lighthouses were the first places to
which electrical illumination was applied, there
are many other purposes for which that species
of light is invaluable. One of the chief of these
is its use in submarine operations. Unlike
other lights, being quite independent of atmospheric
air or any kind of gas for its support, and
merely requiring an attachment of a couple of
gutta-percha-covered wires for its connection with
the source of electricity (which may be at a considerable
distance from the place of combustion),
it is specially applicable to the use of divers. The
importance of a means of brilliantly lighting the
work of those engaged in clearing wreck or laying
the foundations of subaqueous structures cannot be
over-estimated. There is another service too in
which we may hope some day to see it commonly
employed: we mean as a source of light to our
miners. For this purpose, the burner could be
placed in a thick glass globe hermetically closed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">{668}</a></span>
in fact the globe might even be exhausted of air,
for experiments prove that the light is in several
respects improved when burnt in a vacuum! The
danger of fire-damp explosion would by this
means be almost altogether obviated; for unless the
glass were broken (and abundant means suggest
themselves for protecting it), no communication
could be made between the light and the gas-laden
air of the mine. As a means of night-signalling,
the electric light can also be profitably
applied. This can be done by an alphabet of
flashes of varying duration; the readiness with
which the light can be extinguished and rekindled
by the mere touch of a wire, rendering it peculiarly
adapted for such a purpose; while the
distance at which it can be seen is perhaps only
limited by the convexity of the earth. Several of
Her Majesty's ships are now being fitted with the
electric light, which is to serve both for signalling
purposes, and as a precautionary measure against
the attack of torpedo-boats. For military field
operations a brilliant light is often useful; and an
electrical apparatus is in actual use by one of the
belligerents in the present war. In this case, the
light is doubtless worked by an electric battery,
as a steam-engine is hardly a convenient addition
to the impedimenta of a moving column.</p>

<p>Having called our readers' attention to the
several special public uses for which the electric
light is available, we may now consider how far
it can serve us for the more common wants of
every-day life. In its crude state as we have
described it, governed by such a touchy thing as
clock-work, it could not possibly compete with
gas for ordinary purposes. But one or two improvements
have within the last few months been
made, which have led many to hope that the day
is not far distant when the light will become
common in our streets, if not in our houses.</p>

<p>These improvements are two in number. The
one is a plan whereby the electric current can be
subdivided so as to serve a number of different
lights, and the other is an improvement in the
arrangement of the burner. The first-mentioned
invention seems most certainly to bring the system
more on a par with gas-lighting, only that wires
take the place of pipes. But the second offers
features of a more novel character. The carbons,
instead of being placed point to point, one above
the other, as in the old system, are put side by side
and made into a kind of candle. The carbons
therefore represent a double wick; while the portion
of the candle usually made of tallow is made
of kaolin, a form of white clay used in the manufacture
of porcelain. The points are thus kept
at a fixed distance apart; and as they burn,
they vitrify the kaolin between them, which both
checks their waste and adds, by its incandescence,
to the light produced. The old difficulty of keeping
the carbons apart by the aid of clock-work,
therefore disappears. The invention of this
'electric candle' is due to a Russian engineer, M.
Jablochkoff. Another plan which is also credited
to the same inventor is that of doing away with
the carbon-points altogether, and substituting for
them a thin plate of kaolin. The light produced
is said to be softer, steadier, and more constant
than that obtained by any previous method. Successful
experiments with M. Jablochkoff's invention
both in France and England have shewn it to
be readily applicable to many purposes. It was
lately tried at the West India Docks, London,
where its power of illuminating large areas for
the purpose (among others) of unloading ships by
night, was fully demonstrated. Moreover, its
portability is such that it can be carried into the
depths of a ship's hold. We may mention as a
result of these experiments, that the various gas
companies' shares have been depreciated to a considerable
extent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, improvements in the magneto-electric
machine have not been wanting; Siemens in
England and Gramme in France have succeeded
in obtaining intense currents from machines far
less bulky than those of the old pattern. But
still steam-power is required to set them in
motion, and until this is obviated, we cannot
expect that the electric light can become really
available for more general use. The inventors
claim that their method of illumination is, for the
amount of light obtained, far cheaper than any
other known, pleading that one burner is equal to
one hundred gas-lights. But we must remember
that for ordinary purposes this amount of light is
far beyond our needs. In factories where steam-power
is already available, and where the light
would supersede a large number of gas-burners, it
can of course be employed with profit. Indeed we
learn that at several large workshops in different
parts of France the light is in actual use with the
best results. Some of the railway stations both
there and in Belgium are also making arrangements
for its immediate adoption.</p>

<p>The problem, however, which has now to be
solved is, whether the light can be made available
for domestic purposes. We fear that the
necessary motive-power presents an insuperable
objection; for although, as we have explained,
one engine will feed a certain number of lights,
it will bear no comparison in this respect with
the capabilities of a small gas-holder. Besides
which, a man would have far more difficulty
and expense in starting a steam-engine in his
back-garden than he would have (as is commonly
done in country districts) in founding a small gas-factory
for the supply of his premises. Without
losing sight of the benefits which coal-gas has
given us, we may hope that it is not the last and
best kind of artificial illumination open to us. It
blackens our ceilings and walls; it spoils our
books and pictures, besides robbing our dwellings
of oxygen, and giving us instead a close and unhealthy
atmosphere. The combustion of electricity
is on the other hand, as we have already shewn,
<i>independent of any supply of air</i>; and instead of
vitiating the atmosphere, it adds to it a supply of
that sea-side luxury ozone, which may truly be
said to be 'recommended by the faculty.' Besides
these advantages, it can be used without any
sensible rise of temperature. Another great advantage
which its use secures is its actinic qualities,
which would enable artists and all whose
work depends upon a correct appreciation of
colours, to be independent of daylight.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we may say that, beyond the
special uses for the electric light which we have
enumerated, and for which it has by experience
been found practicable, we see no likelihood of
its more general adoption until two requisites are
discovered. The one is a substance that will,
without wasting away and requiring constant
renewal, act as an incandescent burner; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">{669}</a></span>
other is a cheap and ready method of obtaining
the electric fluid. For the former we know not
where to look, for even the hardest diamond disappears
under contact with the electric poles. But
with regard to the latter, we cannot help thinking
how, many years ago, Franklin succeeded by the
aid of a kite-string in drawing electricity from
the clouds. Is it too much to hope that other
philosophers may discover some means not only of
obtaining the luminous fluid from the same source,
but of storing it up for the benefit of all?</p>

<h2><a name="JAPANESE_WRESTLERS" id="JAPANESE_WRESTLERS">JAPANESE WRESTLERS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a fine clear day in February; and the bright
sun shining without a cloud to impede his rays,
lights up the hull of H.M.S. <i>Lyre</i>, swinging lazily
round her anchors in Yokohama Bay. Scarcely a
ripple can be seen on the surface of the water, and
numberless boats are darting to and fro, conveying
passengers from the various ships to the shore. On
board the corvette the blue-jackets and marines are
reclining about the forecastle smoking and sewing,
for it is Thursday afternoon, the day set apart in
English men-of-war for the men to make and mend
their clothes; a concession which Jack values the
more for the privilege of smoking all the afternoon
which accompanies it. Clearly it is not a day for
any one to remain cooped up in a ship, who is not
detained there by duty. So think we officers; for
most of us have shifted into plain clothes, and are
ready to go ashore. The officer of the afternoon
watch, who is endeavouring to beguile the weary
four hours he has to spend on deck by levelling his
spyglass at every object far and near, looks gloomily
at a party of us getting into a sampan, and remarks,
with a view to cheering us up, that the glass is
falling rapidly, and he expects dirty weather before
the night; <i>he</i> wouldn't go ashore if he could, &amp;c.
But we have been at sea too long to be persuaded
out of anything by a little chaff; so with a parting
joke at sour grapes, we get into the crazy little
sampan, and manage to seat ourselves without
capsizing her, a work of some little difficulty.
The four half-naked, muscular little fellows who
form our crew work their long sculls with great
vigour, keeping time to the beat of the unwieldy
oars with a shrill monotonous chant, whose burden
is 'Go ashore! go ashore!'</p>

<p>It is a glorious view that lies before us on that
bright winter day. The long esplanade, or <i>bund</i>,
that fringes the shore is lined with the tall white
houses of the foreign settlement, to the southward
of which is the beautiful wooded hill called the
Bluff, the white cliffs of which are dazzlingly bright
in the sunlight. The bungalows of the foreign
residents are for the most part on the Bluff, each
house inclosed in its own beautiful grounds; and
here too, about two miles from the settlement, is
the race-course, an invariable accompaniment to any
large gathering of Englishmen in the East. Yokohama
itself lies in a valley between the Bluff on
the one hand and the Kanagawa hills on the other;
but inland rises range after range of lofty mountains,
and towering far above everything is the
snow-capped crest of Fusiyama, the 'peerless'
mountain of Japan, which is forty-five miles distant
from the bay where our ship is lying. Fusiyama
is a volcano in the shape of a truncated cone, but
no eruption has taken place for more than a century;
a fortunate thing for the country, as fifty
thousand people are said to have perished at its
last great outbreak, which almost destroyed the
capital, Yeddo. Shocks of earthquake are very
frequent, though slight, in Yokohama and the
neighbouring town, Kanagawa; in fact, most of
Japan is subject to these volcanic disturbances,
which occasionally cause great damage. It is on
this account that the houses are built generally of
such slight materials, as they can endure shocks
which would infallibly overthrow any building
constructed after the European fashion. In the
summer, when the snow has melted from the top
of Fusiyama, bands of pilgrims dressed in white,
who have come from all parts of the empire to worship
the peerless mountain, throng in great numbers
along the roads at its base. At this season
the ascent is often accomplished by foreigners
for the sake of the magnificent view which is
obtained from the summit on a clear day; though
whether it is worth while going through so much
to obtain so little is of course a matter of opinion.
Many people will tell you they go up for the sake
of saying they have been there, forgetting that any
one who has not been there can as easily say the
same thing. For my own part I never could see
the object of climbing a mountain only to come
down again on the other side, and therefore in my
numerous excursions into the interior of Japan, I
gave Fusiyama a wide berth. Ponies are usually
employed by those who believe in the merits of
four legs as compared to two; and the deep ashes
which cover the upper part of the mountain render
this mode of ascent preferable to the severe labour
of climbing on foot. The weather is so clear on
the day in question that the deep gullies down the
sides can be easily traced by the naked eye as we
are pulling ashore.</p>

<p>While we have been admiring the beauties of
the scene, our sampan has passed round the projecting
arm of the English Hatoba, a stone jetty
which protects the landing-place from the heavy
swell which often sets into the bay; so we land
and make our way to the bund with some difficulty,
owing to the crowd of coolies who are passing
to and from the merchants' godowns with heavy
packages slung on bamboo poles between two men.
Now comes the question, how are we to pass our
time? for amusements are somewhat limited in a
small settlement like Yokohama. To be sure, we
can go to the club and play billiards or bowls or
read the papers; but the afternoon is so fine that
it seems a pity to waste it indoors. We might
spend a few hours very pleasantly in the Benten
Doré, a street filled with shops for the sale of
lacquer-work and curiosities of different sorts; but
unfortunately it is nearly the end of the month,
and I need scarcely tell any one acquainted with
the manners and customs of naval officers that
our dollars have grown small by degrees and beautifully
less, and we are anxiously waiting for pay-day.</p>

<p>The most popular idea seems to be to walk
round the race-course to Mississippi Bay, on the
south side of the Bluff, the favourite drive of the
Yokohama ladies; but just as we have resolved on
this, a man passes making some proclamation in a
high sing-song tone, which seems to meet with
general approval from the natives. On inquiring,
we find that he is announcing the arrival of the
champion troupe of wrestlers, who intend giving a
performance that afternoon on a piece of waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">{670}</a></span>
land just outside the boundaries of the foreign
settlement. Nothing could have happened more
apropos; so jumping into some of the odd-looking
little hand-carriages which ply for hire in
great numbers about the streets of most Japanese
towns, we are rattled along the streets at a rapid
rate by the active little drivers, who seem to
possess the enviable faculty of never tiring, for
they trot along as gaily at the end of a thirty miles'
run over indifferent roads, as when they started.
On arriving at our destination, we find numbers of
natives on the same errand, 'gaily dressed in
their Sunday best,' entering an inclosure which
has been hastily made out of long bamboos covered
with matting, to keep out the too curious eyes that
would gaze at the performance gratis. A payment
of a quarter <i>bu</i> each (about threepence in English
money) admits us to the interior, which presents a
very striking scene. Round the sides of the large
inclosure are numerous bamboo stages, crowded
with the wealthier class of natives and a few
foreigners; while in the amphitheatre some thousands
of people are assembled, many of them
women, whose gay robes set off their attractions to
perfection.</p>

<p>Every one has his holiday face on, and the
ceremonious politeness which usually characterises
the meeting of any Japanese, has for the time
given place to mirth and gaiety. Itinerant vendors
of cakes and sweets ply their trade among the
crowd with much apparent success; and here and
there is a stall for the sale of <i>saki</i>, a strong spirit
brewed from rice, and much resembling inferior
sherry in the taste and smell. There is a total
absence of intoxication, and I may say very few
drunken men are ever to be seen about the streets.
By the time we have mounted a stage, and settled
down on the chairs a neatly dressed <i>mus&#365;me</i>
(young girl) has procured for us, the performances
are about to commence, and a man is giving out
the names of the first pair of wrestlers.</p>

<p>In the centre of the amphitheatre a mound has
been raised, on which a ring has been formed
by banking up the earth to the height of a few
inches. Two grave-looking elderly men, apparently
the judges, now seat themselves upon mats on
the mound, and unfurling their paper umbrellas,
light their pipes, and commence smoking in
dignified composure; while the two wrestlers
doff their <i>kimonos</i> (robes) and enter the ring perfectly
naked but for a cloth round the loins. They
are very far removed from our idea of what an
athlete ought to be, for though muscular, they
have an ungainly heaviness of figure. Weight is
indeed thought of such importance in these contests
that men are fattened for them like prize
cattle, under the mistaken belief that such size is
an advantage to the fortunate possessor!</p>

<p>A tedious preliminary performance has to be
gone through before the actual business of wrestling
commences. Each man comes to the centre of the
ring, and squatting down in front of his antagonist,
raises each leg in turn, and then brings it down
heavily on the ground, at the same time striking
his thigh smartly with his open hand. I suppose
this is meant as a sort of challenge; but it has an
extremely ludicrous effect, at least to foreigners,
to see two very fat men so employing themselves.
Both men now quit the ring and take a draught
of water and a pinch of salt, while they rub their
arms and hands with mud, in order that they may
get a better hold of each other's naked body. At
length they re-enter the ring, and the real struggle
now begins. They squat in front of each other like
two huge frogs and strike their hands together, at
the same time uttering a curious hissing noise,
which gets louder and louder till they suddenly
fly at each other like angry cats. Heavy blows
and slaps are exchanged freely in the effort to close,
but umpires are behind each shouting out cautions
at any attempted infringement of the rules on
either side. When they have fairly got hold of
each other many a cunning feint and twist is shewn,
and the struggling bodies and limbs entwine so
rapidly that the pair look like one gigantic octopus.
At length the bout is concluded by one man being
hurled bodily out of the ring into the crowd outside,
and the cheering from the excited spectators
is absolutely deafening. The victor stalks about
the ring for some time in great dignity, receiving
the congratulations of his friends, and then repeats
his former challenge, striking his thighs heavily
and crowing like a bantam cock. Another wrestler,
nothing daunted, at once comes forward to try his
fortune; while the vanquished combatant, who has
picked himself up amidst a running fire of chaff
from the unsympathising crowd, resumes his
<i>kimono</i> with an assumed air of indifference and
vanishes behind the spectators.</p>

<p>Three men in succession did the first victor
overthrow before he found a foeman worthy of
his grip; but he too in turn soon succumbed
to a fresh challenger. The judges during all the
confusion maintained their seats in great dignity,
and smoked away with quiet unconcern while the
wrestlers strove and kicked beside them. Their
office seemed to be to settle any disputes; but it
was almost a sinecure, as I saw hardly any during
the afternoon, everything being conducted with
perfect fairness and good-humour. All the hard
work seemed to be done by the umpires, who were
dancing about each combatant in a perfect state of
frenzy, and their repeated screams of 'Anatta!
anatta!' (Sir! sir!) when any unfair movement
was attempted on either side, soon reduced their
voices to mere croaks. To win a round, a man
had either to lay his opponent flat on the ground
or thrust him out of the ring. Several of the first
bouts we witnessed were decided in the latter
manner, a heavy man driving his antagonist clean
out of the circle by the weight and impetus of his
first assault. Any method whatever seemed to be
allowed in catching hold; I saw one man win a
heat by dexterously catching his opponent by the
scruff of the neck and jamming his head on the
ground, the whole body perforce following suit.
This seemed to be regarded as a sort of 'fool's
mate,' for I noticed that the loser was much
laughed at; and although the same man&#339;uvre was
attempted several times afterwards, it was never
successful.</p>

<p>The light weights had their contest first; and
then came the middle weights, if such a term can
be applied to men of fifteen stone at least. But
the real event of the day was the concluding
struggle between the champions, about a dozen in
number, who would have passed muster in any
assembly where height and strength were the test.
Not one of them was under six feet in height, and
most of them were considerably over; one gigantic
fellow must have been nearly seven feet. All of
them were disfigured by the same inordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">{671}</a></span>
amount of flesh; but the muscles of the arms
and legs were very powerfully developed, and the
activity displayed in spite of their enormous size
was something marvellous. In one severe contest
the gigantic champion threw a lesser athlete clear
out of the ring on to the heads of the spectators
below, overwhelming one of the unfortunate judges
in the transit. The latter, however, soon arose,
gave himself a shake, and resumed his pipe and
seat, apparently none the worse for his rude
shock.</p>

<p>The final contest of the day, which took place
just before dusk, was between our friend the giant
and the next biggest of the band; and after a
severe struggle, ended in the former being thrown
as scientifically as ever I wished to see. The earth
shook with the violence of the fall; but the vanquished
hero picked himself up at once, and with
a good-humoured laugh at his opponent, resumed
his <i>kimono</i>; and the sports were concluded.</p>

<p>Not the least amusing part of the afternoon's
amusement was afforded by a blue-jacket on leave
from the <i>Lyre</i>, who threw his cap into the ring, and
wanted to try conclusions with the biggest man of
the party for a few dollars. A long and amusing
conversation took place between the sailor and the
natives; but the challenge was not accepted, so
Jack put on his hat and walked jauntily away. He
was a tall powerful man, and I daresay could have
held his own against the giant himself, in spite of
his inferiority of weight; for it is a well-known
fact that the enormous amount of flesh cultivated
by the Japanese wrestlers stands seriously in their
way when opposed to a foreigner in good condition.
It is not very many years ago that a shining light
of the English Church in the East came to Japan
and astonished the natives by throwing some of
their best men. No doubt, before many years, the
Japanese, who are very quick at seizing any new
idea, will perceive the folly of feeding their athletes
to such a size, and follow the English system of
training. A very noticeable feature about these
contests was the perfect good-humour with which
they were conducted, not a single man losing his
temper, in spite of the heavy blows and cuffs which
were exchanged with great vigour before closing
with each other. While discussing the afternoon's
amusement, we walked to the bund in the twilight,
and a twelve-oared cutter soon took us on
board in time for dinner. Next morning at daylight
we were under weigh for Hong-kong.</p>

<p class='ph3'>A WAKE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Tim Scanlan</span>, while he lived, was only a labouring
man; but he was well liked in the country;
and it was expected that his funeral would be an
unusually large gathering. Crowds flocked to the
wake, and a great provision of tea, whisky, pipes,
and tobacco had been made. The widow occupied
her post of honour at the head of the coffin, and
displayed a fair show of grief, joining in with
vociferous weeping whenever the 'keening' was
led by the older women. She was young enough
to have been the dead man's daughter, having
come to his house a 'slip' of a servant-girl,
whom he had married and ruled over very masterfully.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, the whisky began to tell
on those outside the room where the corpse lay.
The noise increased, and soon apparently became
loud enough to 'wake the dead,' as the saying is;
for to the consternation and amazement of every
one present, the defunct, after a deep sigh and
sundry groans, opened his eyes and struggled up
into a sitting posture. When the startled company
had recovered from the shock, poor Tim was lifted
out of the coffin; whisky was liberally
poured down his throat; and well wrapped up in
blankets and seated in the big chair by the fire,
he gradually revived from the trance or stupor
that had been mistaken for death. The last of
the guests had departed from the cabin, and Tim,
still propped up before the fire, was left to the
care of his wife. Instead of coming near him
however, she slunk off, cringing timidly away
into a dark corner behind his chair, whence she
directed frightened glances at her resuscitated
spouse.</p>

<p>'Mary!' said the man in a stern voice.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>'Are you there?' peering round, his face
quivering with anger and weakness.</p>

<p>'Yis, Tim, I'm here,' faltered Mary, without
stirring.</p>

<p>'Bring me my stick.'</p>

<p>'Ah, no, Tim; no! Sure you never rose yer
hand to me yet! And 'tisn't now, when you're
all as one as come back from the dead, that'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bring me my stick.'</p>

<p>The stick was brought, and down on her knees
beside the big chair flopped the cowering wife.</p>

<p>'Well you know what you desarve. Well
you know, you young thief o' the world! that if
I was to take and beat you this blessed minute
as black as a mourning-coach, 'twould be only
sarving you right, after the mean, dirthy, shameful
turn you've done me!'</p>

<p>'It would, it would!' sobbed the girl.</p>

<p>'Look here!' gasped Tim, opening his breast and
shewing an old tattered shirt. 'Look at them
rags! Look at what you dressed up my poor
corpse in; shaming me before all the decent neighbours
at the wake! An' you knowing as well as I
did about the elegant brand-new shirt I'd bought
o' purpose for my berrin; a shirt I wouldn't have
put on my living back&mdash;no, not if I had gone
naked in my skin! You knew I had it there in the
chest laid up; and you grudged it to my unfortunate
carcase when I couldn't spake up for myself!'</p>

<p>'O Tim, darlin', forgive me!' cried Mary. 'Forgive
me this once, and on my two knees I promise
never, never to do the likes again! I don't know
what came over me at all. Sure, I think, the
divil&mdash;Lord save us!&mdash;must have been at my
elbow when I went to get out the shirt; tempting
me, and whispering that it was a pity and a sin to
put good linen like that into the clay. Oh, how
could I do it at all?'</p>

<p>'Now, hearken to me, Mary;' and Tim raised
the stick and laid it on her shoulder. She knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">{672}</a></span>
he wouldn't beat her even if he could with his
trembling hands; but she pretended to wince and
cower away. 'Mind what I say. As sure as you
do me the like turn again, and go for to dress me
in those undacent rags, I tell you what I'll do&mdash;I'll
<i>walk</i>.'</p>

<p>'O don't, Tim, don't!' shrieked Mary, as pale as
ashes. 'Murther me now, if it's plazing to you, or
do anything to me you like; but for the love of
the blessed Vargin and all the Saints, keep in yer
grave! I'll put the new shirt on you; my two
hands 'll starch it and make it up as white as
snow, after lying by so long in the old chest.
Yer corpse will look lovely, niver fear! And I'll
give you the grandest wake that iver man had,
even if I had to sell the pig, and part with every
stick in the cabin to buy the tay and the whisky.
I swear to you I will, darlin'. There's my hand
on it, this blessed night!'</p>

<p>'Well, mind you do, or 'twill be worse for you.
And now give me a drop of wather to drink, and
put a taste of sperrits through it; for I'm like to
faint with thirst and with weakness.'</p>

<p>Mary kept her promise; for such a wake was
never remembered as Tim Scanlan's, when, soon
after, the poor man really did depart this life.
And the 'get up' of the 'elegant brand-new shirt'
in which the corpse was arrayed, was the admiration
of all beholders.</p>

<h2><a name="CARRIER-PIGEONS" id="CARRIER-PIGEONS">CARRIER-PIGEONS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> value of these birds as carriers of messages
was interestingly demonstrated at the siege of
Paris, as it used to be in the French war seventy
years ago, before the invention of the electric telegraph.
It now appears that carrier-pigeons may be
employed with advantage in taking messages from
boats engaged in the Scottish herring-fisheries,
when no species of telegraph is available. The
following notice of the fact occurs in the <i>Fishing
Gazette</i>:</p>

<p>'The experiment which was tried last year
of employing carrier-pigeons for the purpose of
bringing early intelligence each morning from
the fishing-ground of the results of the night's
labour, is again being resorted to this season, and
with the most satisfactory results. One of the
birds is taken out in each boat in the afternoon;
and after the nets have been hauled on the following
morning and the extent of the catch ascertained,
the pigeon is despatched with a small piece
of parchment tied round its neck, containing information
as to the number of crans on board, the
position of the boat, the direction of the wind, and
the prospects of the return journey, &amp;c. If there is
not wind to take the boat back, or if it is blowing
in an unfavourable direction, a request is made
for a tug; and from the particulars given as to the
bearings of the craft, she can be picked up easily
by the steamer. The other advantages of the
system are that, when the curers are apprised of
the quantity of herrings they may expect, they can
make preparations for expediting the delivering
and curing of the fish. Most of the pigeons belong
to Messrs Moir and Son, Aberdeen. When let off
from the boats, the birds invariably circle three
times round overhead, and then sweep away
towards the land with great rapidity, generally
flying at the rate of about a mile per minute.
Two superior birds in Messrs Moir's possession
have occasionally come a distance of twenty or
twenty-five miles in as many minutes; and on
Tuesday one of these pigeons came home sixteen
miles in the same number of minutes. Another
of Messrs Moir's pigeons flew on board the <i>Heatherbell</i>
on Tuesday afternoon off the Girdleness, bearing
a slip of paper containing the intelligence that
the boat from which it had been despatched at
11.54 had a cargo of twenty-five barrels of herrings.
The pigeons require very little training, and soon
know where to land with their message. A cot
has been fitted up on the roof of Messrs Moir's
premises at the quay for the accommodation of the
birds, and they invariably alight there on their
return from sea.'</p>

<p>According to the London newspapers, there was
lately an amusing experiment to test the flight of
carrier-pigeons against the speed of a railway train.
The following is the account given of this curious
race, which took place on the 13th July: 'The
race was from Dover to London between the continental
mail express train and a carrier-pigeon
conveying a document of an urgent nature from
the French police. The pigeon, which was bred
by Messrs Hartley and Sons of Woolwich, and
"homed" when a few weeks old to a building in
Cannon Street, City, was of the best breed of homing
pigeons, known as "Belgian voyageurs." The
bird was tossed through the railway carriage
window by a French official as the train moved
from the Admiralty Pier, the wind being west and
the atmosphere hazy, but with the sun shining.
For upwards of a minute the carrier-pigeon circled
round to an altitude of about half a mile, and then
sailed away towards London. By this time the
train, which carried the European mails, and was
timed not to stop between Dover and Cannon
Street, had got up to full speed, and was proceeding
at the rate of sixty miles an hour towards London.
The odds at starting seemed against the bird;
and the railway officials predicted that the little
messenger would be beaten in the race. The
pigeon, however, as soon as it ascertained its bearings,
took the nearest homeward route in a direction
midway between Maidstone and Sittingbourne,
the distance "as the crow flies" between
Dover and London being seventy miles, and by
rail seventy-six and a half miles. When the continental
mail express came into Cannon Street
station, the bird had been home twenty minutes;
having beaten Her Majesty's royal mail by a time
allowance representing eighteen miles.'</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
